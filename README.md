Project Title : Expense Tracker App

Project Description : 
The Expense Tracker is an Android mobile application designed to manage group expenses, particularly for trips and shared activities. 
It allows users to create trips, add members, track expenses, calculate balances, view creditors and debtors, analyze spending patterns through graphs, and generate bills stored locally on the device. 
Data storage is handled via JSONBin.io, a cloud-based API service that provides four dedicated bins for users, trips, member balances, and expenses.
This application simplifies splitting bills among group members, promotes financial transparency, and aids in budgeting.
